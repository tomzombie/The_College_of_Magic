necromancy
	necromancy is not taught at University officially but if you are diligent, clever, and can get into restricted sections of various libraries you can learn it. The practice of necromancy is strictly regulated and is grounds for immediate expulsion if done without concent of the senior faculty.  This is all stemming from an incident back when necromancy was taught that involved a zombie hoard and many student deaths
